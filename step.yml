# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
# https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_docs/step-development-guideline.md

# project_type_tags:
#   - ios
#   - macos
#   - android
#   - xamarin
#   - react-native

# Type tags are used for categorizing steps, for easier step discovery in Step Libraries.
